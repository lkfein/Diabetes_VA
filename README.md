# Diabetes in Virginia 
**This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2025 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**
# Purpose
This repository will provide information on diabetes in Virginia between the years 2014 and 2015, as well as documentation of the methodlogies and code structure. It was created through Google Colab using Python and Markdown. It will be useful for providing a focused look on diabetes within the United States, helping to support local level decision making. It may be used for state health initiatives, examining geographic disparities, the assessment of community health needs and much more.
