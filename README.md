# Diabetes in Virginia 
This repository will provide information on diabetes in Virginia between the years 2014 and 2015, as well as documentation of the methodlogies and code structure. It was created through google colab using python and markdown. It's useful for providing a focused look on diabetes within the US, helping to support local level decision making. To get started, browse through the two folders within the repository (documentation and data). These folders contain the process of colab, raw data and the data subset. This repository was created and is maintained by Lucy Feinsot, the primary developer and analyst. This visual shown below shows the relative increase in diabetes in VA (2014-15), which is exactly what this repository is trying to show. [This is the county health data this information was derived from] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Um1S95F-zrRB4Yt7J0-BUJ0Wc_85D0jYfWM0zTthG4/edit?gid=1340371714#gid=1340371714)
